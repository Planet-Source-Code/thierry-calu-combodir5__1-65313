First of all it's my first submission on PSC so be cool.

Sorry guys but my code isn't bug free... 
  - i tested only under XP SP1 and SP2
  - i did'nt spend enough time on it
  - i am not working on it any more...
	
Things i am proud:
  - The way i deal with properties 'RootFolder' and 'StartingFolder' with the API: ILCreateFromPathW 
	(look in Private Sub yShowFolderBrowse) that never see any where
  - The idea

Thinks really bad:
  - search the word 'uggly' in the usercontrol 'ucComboDir5' and read the comment
  - not yet finished...
